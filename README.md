# BOBL Guild Hall Upgrade Plan

This repository contains an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault that includes an interactive upgrade plan for leveling a guild hall to the services desired specifically by the BOBL guild.

To view and interact with the vault:

1. Download and install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
2. Download this repository (use git or the download option above)
3. Optionally: rename the top-most folder of the vault
4. Open the vault in Obsidian. The first time you open the vault you will have click the button that reads "Trust author and enable plugins" then close the settings window.

At this point 2 tabs should already be open. The first outlines the upgrade plan and some notes. The second tab is an interactive checklist of upgrades for the guild hall. Only the upgrades that are unlockable are displayed, as more are completed, the list is further populated.
